/** Closed-form jump solve: the microsecond fast path tried ahead of the CMA-ES multistart.
 *
 *  <p>It exploits the proven structure (horizontal motion is linear in the per-tick input vectors; the
 *  only nonconvexity is each input's fixed modulus) by solving the convex Lagrangian dual
 *  ({@link CostateDualSolver}) to global optimality and recovering each tick's optimal yaw as the direction
 *  of its friction-propagated costate ({@link JumpLinearModel}). That is the entire continuous solve: a few
 *  microseconds, no search, no tuning.
 *
 *  <p>The continuous optimum hugs the active walls exactly; MC's 65536-bucket sine table then perturbs the
 *  realized path by ~1e-4 blocks, which could nudge a tight wall to the wrong side. So the walls are solved
 *  with a small inward margin and the result is re-checked on the byte-exact {@link ExactJumpModel}; the
 *  margin is grown geometrically until the quantized trajectory is strictly feasible. Each attempt is
 *  microseconds, so even several attempts stay far under a millisecond.
 *
 *  <p>Returns absolute wrapped facings strictly feasible on the exact model, or {@code null} when the
 *  closed form does not apply (facing walls) or cannot certify feasibility; the caller then falls
 *  back to the full multistart, so this only ever makes solving faster, never less reliable. */
