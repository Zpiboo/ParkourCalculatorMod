# Parkour Calculator

A TAS input planning mod for Minecraft. Simulate and visualize parkour movements before executing them.

Watch the [angle solver tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ModmozoWaD0) or a [TAS created with the tool](https://youtu.be/YFWhPtJkWmY).

## Features

- Plan movement inputs tick-by-tick (WASD, jump, sneak, sprint, yaw)
- Visualize the predicted path as boxes in the world
- Drag the start box to test different setups
- Angle solver: given your inputs and constraints, computes the best yaw angles for a jump
- Replay planned inputs in-game with the TAS list following the active tick
- Per-tick movement info (motion, speed, combined XZ distance)
- Save and load input plans
- Pin windows for quick access
- Supports Fabric 1.21.10, Forge 1.8.9, and Forge 1.12.2

## Usage

Press `G` to open the calculator. The toggle key is rebindable in Minecraft's **Controls** menu (Fabric and Forge both register it under the `Parkour Calculator` category).

### Adding Inputs

1. Click key columns to toggle inputs
2. Drag across columns to set multiple keys
3. Enter YAW values for rotation

### Managing Rows

- Right-click to add rows
- Click to select, Ctrl+Click to multi-select
- Shift+Click for range selection
- Delete key to remove selected rows
- Drag rows to reorder

### Moving Start Position

Click and drag the first box in the world to reposition.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `G` | Toggle UI (rebindable) |

## Building from Source

Requires JDK 21.

```bash
./gradlew :loader-fabric-1.21.10:build
```

The output JAR lands in `loader-fabric-1.21.10/build/libs/`.

The repo is a Gradle multi-module project: `core/` holds Minecraft-free UI code (Java 8 compatible), and `loader-fabric-1.21.10/` is the Fabric mod itself. See `CLAUDE.md` for architecture details.

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow. Quick summary: feature branches off `main`, PR titles use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:`), squash-merge only. Versioning, tagging, CHANGELOG entries, and publication of the three loader jars are automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).
