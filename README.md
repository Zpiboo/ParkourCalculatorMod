Requires JDK 21.

```bash
./gradlew :loader-fabric-1.21.10:build
```

The output JAR lands in `loader-fabric-1.21.10/build/libs/`.

The repo is a Gradle multi-module project: `core/` holds Minecraft-free UI code (Java 8 compatible), and `loader-fabric-1.21.10/` is the Fabric mod itself. See `CLAUDE.md` for architecture details.
